WORK EXPERIENCE 

DevOps Engineer @ Nordensol (July 2020 - Present)

* Designed CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, docker, and AWS) committing code in Github with built environments (Dev, stage & Prod), using Jenkins, reducing release cycles by 50%. Maven integrated with Nexus for artifact storage. SonarQube for code analysis with appropriate quality gate implementation, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization. Slack for feedback


* CloudFormation/terraform modules, for provisioning and management of infrastructure and Parameter Store, enabling reusability and discouraging value hardcoding.

* I configured the remote backend for the Terraform state file with an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table as a lock for the file, reducing manual intervention and errors by 70%.

* Ansible for the continuous deployment of the monolithic application and orchestration with Jenkins.

* Collaboration with different teams by agile methodology using Kanban for project facilitation.

* Docker and Kubernetes to isolate and pack software and dependencies by automating their deployment and scaling with minimal errors.


AWS Solutions Architect @ Y-Prime  (Nov 2019 - Apr 2020)

* Implemented IAM best practices and role-based access control for AWS accounts, ensuring the least privileged access.

* Client collaboration for product improvement.

* Multi-part upload of clients' old data to S3 buckets, implementing versioning, life-cycle management, automating backups from their local system buckets, and preventing accidental deletion and vault-locking confidential documents.

* Proposed high-performing, available, resilient, and efficient 3-tier architecture for client's applications.

* I also proposed a real-time data pipeline for a piece of field machinery, using AWS (AWS IoT, AWS Glue, Kinesis data streams, Redshift, Athena, and S3 using Quick Sight for visualization).

* I created static websites for different projects using a CloudFront distribution for speedy content distribution and Route 53 for traffic routing to the distribution.

* Created Pre-signed URLs for access to private company S3 buckets when needed
